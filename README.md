# Attic

# Synopsis

ATTIC is a photo sharing application that allows users to login to an account, create multiple photo albums, upload images to those albums and invite others to collaborate on those albums. Comments can be left on individual images and users have the ability to delete images as well as download them. 

# Motivation

As someone who lives miles from my family we often send photographs back and forth via email. Having a number of older family members who are hesitant to sign up for Facebook or Instagram I decided to make an easy to use web application that would allow us to share photos and collaborate on albums. This project also served as my front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School.
